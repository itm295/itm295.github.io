# ITM 295 Portfolio Service Project Purpose
ITM 295 Portfolio Service Project engages students in service-learning opportunities to bless other lives by
using the skills and knowledge they gained through their course of study in their program. It
is designed to help students achieve the mission of BYU-Idaho to – “develop disciples of Jesus
Christ who are leaders in their homes, the Church, and their communities” ([University Mission
Statement](https://www.byui.edu/about/byu-idaho-mission-statement)).
