# ITM 295 Portfolio Service Project Purpose

using the skills and knowledge they gained through their course of study in their degree program. It
is designed to help students achieve the mission of BYU-Idaho to – “develop disciples of Jesus
Christ who are leaders in their homes, the Church, and their communities” ([University Mission
