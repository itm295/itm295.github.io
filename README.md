# CIT 295 Practicum / ITM 295R Portfolio Service Project

## Why a Service Project?
Do you like to do nice things for people? Do like technology? Can you learn by helping others?
If you answer yes to these questions, this is where you can gain college credit for it.

## How can I find a place to get started?
How about trying a way where the opportunities can find you? Several students have discovered the power
of social networking and professional networking by creating and sharing a post and then engaging in 
conversation until the right opportunity opens up. Please note that non-profit and public service organizations
(like schools and government organizations) make this whole process much simpler for everyone.

## What do I need to do to be authorized to register for the course?
The short version is that you will need to submit two documents to the Course Instructor at [cit295@byui.edu](mailto:cit295@byui.edu):
1. Write a proposal and receive an authorization from the course instructor. (see [Proposal Template](https://webmailbyui-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/kwg6_byui_edu/EdPa8RcFIapCmV_dXcCBu_EBQg1gU6-3d7yImB2nKVfaAw))
2. Have your project beneficiary (the organization and/or person benefitting from the service) acknowledge compliance with applicable labor laws such as the Fair Labor Standards Act or FLSA (in the United States, beneficiaries can submit the [Attestation for No Compensation](https://webmailbyui-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/kwg6_byui_edu/EdtlZDQalHVEtLuMXKSjsKMBRb52AV-dW3KGRQ10s7R67Q?e=5vZjTt)).
